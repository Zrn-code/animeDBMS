# AnimeDBMS

## Purpose and Motivation

Technology begins with human nature, and within this group, we have gathered a community of university students passionate about anime. Over the years, our experiences in following anime have led us to face various challenges, including the difficulty of finding anime that aligns with our preferences and effectively organizing our watchlists. Seizing this opportunity, we aim to create an anime management website to address these issues, benefiting ourselves and fellow enthusiasts who share the same passion.

## Project Goals

Within this website, our primary goals are to implement the following features:

-   **Record user viewing history and ratings**
-   **Filter anime that users have not watched yet**
-   **Utilize text search to narrow down anime choices**
-   **Provide anime recommendations based on usersâ€™ preferences**
-   **Offer access to anime-related summaries, rating data, and reviews.**

Feel free to explore our project and join us in enhancing the anime-watching experience!
